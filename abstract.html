					<font size=4>
						Our group participated in a school bazaar project where various handmade and environmentally friendly products were sold. This activity was designed to develop entrepreneurial skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork while incorporating sustainable practices. We offered photo booth, orchid hair clips, Indonesia-themed slime, batik ruffle headbands, phone straps, batik tote bag sets (with educational cards and stickers), jasmine aromatherapy candles (environmentally friendly biotechnology), mini tiramisu cakes, basreng, cireng, regal balls, iced tea, and Pop Ice drinks. Each product underwent multiple trials and improvements before being finalized for the bazaar. Careful planning was conducted to ensure efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and appeal to buyers.
                        <br><br>
						For the planning phase, we brainstormed product ideas, considering uniqueness, feasibility, and production costs. Tasks were divided among team members based on skills and preferences, a timeline was created for trials, and ingredients and materials were sourced efficiently. Adjustments were made based on test results, ensuring quality and practicality before finalizing our product lineup. During the preparation phase, several challenges were encountered, especially with products made from scratch. The jasmine aromatherapy candle initially failed to harden properly when cooking oil and crayons were used instead of new wax. Stearin was added to improve solidification, but the crayon pigment settled unevenly, and its strong smell overpowered the jasmine scent. 
                        <br><br>
						After consulting a biology teacher, we learned that drying the flowers first was necessary for better fragrance release. Research also revealed that crayons must be fully melted to ensure even blending. Similarly, the cireng dough became too firm instead of elastic due to incorrect flour proportions. To fix this, the dough was reheated on low heat while gradually adding hot water, improving elasticity but lacking the ideal crispy exterior. Further refinements were made in seasoning and frying techniques to enhance texture and flavor.	
                        <br><br>
						On the day of the bazaar, all products were successfully prepared and displayed. The photo booth was set up strategically to attract visitors, and a well-organized selling strategy was implemented to maximize sales. Teamwork was consistently maintained, ensuring that each product was properly presented and promoted. The event resulted in high sales and positive feedback from customers.
                        <br><br>
						<b>Lessons Learned: </b>
                        <br><br>
                        This project provided valuable insights into product development, financial management, and strategic marketing. Through multiple trial-and-error processes, adjustments were continuously made to improve product quality. The importance of clear communication and efficient teamwork was reinforced, as each member’s contribution was essential in ensuring success. Additionally, problem-solving skills were sharpened as solutions were found to unexpected challenges. Ultimately, this experience was highly beneficial, equipping us with real-world entrepreneurial and collaborative skills.
